                Hi all, I am Herman Vulkers. I am a starting web developer in Utrecht, The Netherlands. Since a couple of years, I've been dabbling in different coding languages as a hobby. During the COVID pandemic, I decided to take a more serious approach and commit to a career switch from drone operator to web developer. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                During September 2021, I enrolled in a Full Stack Web Development course at Bit-Academy in The Netherlands. Some of the languages that I learned to work with more intensively are HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Some facts about me, in no particular order:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>For more than a decade, I worked as a professional drone pilot.</li>
                <li>I celebrated the 2018 Vietnamese Women's Day in a remote mountain village near China.</li>
                <li>My favorite computer game when I was 6 years old was Power Pete on our Macintosh Performa.</li>
                <li>I worked closely with government institutions as a business development manager at a large drone company.</li>
                <li>My favorite music genres are rock, metal, techno, hiphop and triphop/downtempo.</li>
            </ul>
